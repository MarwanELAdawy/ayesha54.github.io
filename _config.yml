  I am a young professional, graduated in **Computer Science** and having a year of working experience as a software research and development engineer at silicon valleyâ€™s startup named securiti.ai where I design and develop different small tools and microservices in Python and Golang, research about the cybersecurity and data protection regulatory compliances and frameworks such as CCPA and GDPR. 

  I have also worked with different programming languages, **front-end** technology stacks such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and javascript, **MVC** frameworks such as Laravel and Ruby on Rails in my whole internships and freelancing career. I am also familiar with the **DevOps** technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes and Ansible as I am always eager to learn and ready to take on new challenges and work with different technology stack.

  Apart from professional information, I have been involved in different volunteering activities and have been a part of **The Citizen Organization** where I have volunteered in the Rahbar's Program for six weeks. I am a sports lover and love to play **Badminton** at Pakistan Sports Board, **Swimming** at Women Sports Complex and **Cycling** with GG Riders on every weekend. I am also really fond of **Traveling** and Hunza-Gilgit Baltistan is one of my favourite place to travel solo. I like to read books in my leisure time and stephen covey is one of my favourite writter.
  My ultimate goals are to become a good programmer and travel around the world. I also write technical blogs on **Medium** in my leisure time.
